    "The interaction withe the model has changed slightly so that linear flow rate LF = F/area is used. The column volume is now specified in terms of (cross-section) area times height. Thus by changing area the scale up works fine and what you do in practice. Further the time unit changed from seconds to minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has 5 states as listed below, 3 states in liquid mobile phase and 2 states for the gel for bound proteins. In a few of Jonas figures also bound ions of the buffer are plotted but I do not do that. Bound ions of the buffer can be calculated from the difference of total binding capaciety $Q_{av}$ and bound protein and bound protein antagonist, see section 5.1 in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The molecular weights listed below are not used in the simulations. They just give typical values and the molecular weight for bound protein and antagonist protein is just arbitrary here.\n",

    "Parameters of the model in general as well as time scale are all arbitrary and focus is on qualitative aspects of the model.\n",
